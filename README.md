# About this Repository
This you could say, my first ever Repository I've ever created so it's expected to see that there is less information and quite possible more mistakes.

# Less Info on Lab 2
To explain why there isn't much in it. Well that's because I forgot to save it which made me have to reset the Data again but the problem is that I forgot what code I put but have already given the data.
