# About this Repository
This you could say, my first ever Repository I've ever created so it's expected to see that there is less information and quite possible more mistakes.

# Labs / Projects
Through Weeks and Months, I had been doing many projects/labs and most of them. I don't really understand. But I kept trying to at least get the answer for them.

# Labs Infos
- Lab 2: My 1st type of lab I made. There are a lot of errors and less information there. The reason for it is because I forgot to save it and was very confused about the functions of R.Studio. But still, I managed to recover some of the data.
- Lab 3: This lab was my first ever plot type of lab. At first, I would say it was understanding and easy to learn but after a day or so, I completely forgot all the information regarding it.
- Lab 5: This lab too was very understanding for me but again after a day or so. I completely forgot all of it.
- Lab 7: This lab was very confusing to me. I could not understand it. And one of the hardest lab I ever done but I still manage to answer the questions though.
- Lab 8: This lab was by far the hardest for me. I was very confused on how to start this lab because of the dataset I chose. I would say, not suitable for this Lab.
